This is the repository documenting my project on Drug Sentiment Classification. The project aims to roleplay a scenario faced by a Data Scientist of a pharmaceutical company. It outlines the data pipeline and compares machine learning models used in the sentiment analysis of over 100 drugs on a highly realistic and messy dataset. The final model is combined with a business alignment process to clarify the business value of the automation of sentiment analysis and reach a recommendation for the imagined client.

The following repositories are included:

- Script: contains all the executables to reproduce the models and the data and business value sensitivity analysis. 
- Model: contains the save of all explored classifiers, gridsearch objects and model results.
- Data: contains all data and intermediates pertinent to the project
- Report: contains all the reports outlining the results of the project
- A good start to begin understanding the approaches of the project is to read the Final Report in the Report repository.
