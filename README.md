# Capstone Projects (Full Scale Data Science Projects)

## [Building A Spam Filter With Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/zachnguyen/Data-Science---Springboard/tree/master/SMS%20Spam%20Filter)

![Spam Filtering](https://github.com/zachnguyen/Data-Science---Springboard/blob/master/images/Sms%20filter.PNG)

### Key points:
- Python tools: Pandas, Json, Nltk, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Spacy, Statsmodel.
- Performed spam classification for hypothetical a hypothetical telecom, achieving a model with 99.4% accuracy score and 0.997 AUC (Area Under the Curve) Score.
- Created a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline to process sms messages at throughput of +100 sms/s.
- Converted data to bag of word features and modeled the training data to several algorithms, including Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SVC and XGBoost.
- Regularized best algorithm architecture with F-Beta score to ensure alignment with business objectives.
- Deployed [Spam Filter](http://spamfilter-env.eba-5zbpxzwv.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/) onto AWS instance with Dockerization and Flask so that anyone could filter Spams.

## [Sentiment Analysis with Neural Network techniques](https://github.com/zachnguyen/Data-Science---Springboard/tree/master/Drug%20Sentiment%20Review)

![Drug Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/zachnguyen/Data-Science---Springboard/blob/master/images/Sentiment_Analysis_drug.PNG)

### Key Points:
- Python tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Spacy, Gensim, Sci-Py, Tensorflow/Keras.
- Performed sentiment analysis on a highly realistic dataset provided by Analytics Vidha with over 100 drugs for a hypothetical Canadian pharmaceutical, achieving a model with 0.5 F1 macro score with Grid-Search for Hyper-parameter Tuning and Cross Validation.
- Aligned the best algorithm with business objectives by creating trade-off gradient to identify scenarios in which automation of the Sentiment Analysis task is profitable, potentially with a saving of +$400 per 1000 reviews.
- Ran dimensionality reduction algorithms such as TSNE and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to explore language dataset structure.
- Modeled the training data to several algorithms, including Word embedding algorithms (with Skip-Gram, Matrix Factorization and Transfer Learning) and Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) component.
