This is the repository documenting my project on Spam filtering Text Classification. The following repositories are included:

- Script: contains all the executables to reproduce the model and spam filter
- Model: contains the save of all explored classifiers
- Data: contains all data and intermediates pertinent to the project
- Report: contains all the reports outlining the results of the project

A good start to begin understanding the approaches of the project is to read the Final Report in the Report repository.
